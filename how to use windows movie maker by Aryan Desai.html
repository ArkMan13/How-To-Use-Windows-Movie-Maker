To create a movie,you have to start a new project.A movie project is a file that contains information about the arrangement <br>
of various pictures,video/audio clips and effects used to make a movie.<br><br>
Once you open Windows Movie Maker 2012,you can directly start creating a movie.If Movie Maker is already open and you want to start <br>
working on a new project,click the Movie Maker icon and select New Project option from the drop-down menu.<br><br>
Once you have started a new project,creating a movie consists of the following steps :<br><br><br>
(a)Adding videos and photos

Maker 2012 for any additions and modifications.<br><br>
When the movie project that you are working on is saved as a movie,it is saved in a video format (for example,MPEG-4,MOV,etc.)<br>
that can run on any media player like windows media player,etc.You cannot make further modifications in a file that is saved in <br>
any video format .Such a process is also known as rendering a movie.<br><br><br>
